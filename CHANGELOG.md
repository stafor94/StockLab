## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added
- Pure TypeScript market-calendar engine for Korean and U.S. trading sessions.
- `+1일`, `+1주`, and `+1개월` game-date progression with joint-market holiday skipping.

- Cached JSON data client with lazy per-asset price loading.
- Runtime validation for external JSON data before it reaches the game engine.
